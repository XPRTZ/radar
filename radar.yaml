  description: '<b>Progressive Web Apps</b> are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. By utilizing service workers that allow intercepting and control of how a web browser handles its network requests and asset caching, the user has reliable fast web pages and offline experience. One of our projects that uses a PWA is <a href="https://www.terraindex.com">TerraIndex</a> that allows its field workers that have to cope with unstable mobile connection and still have a reliable web app experience. You can get also started with a beginners tutorial <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/">here</a>'

Later he called this his billion-dollar mistake and apologized for the problem this has caused. C# was one of the languages that copied this feature and its developers and users had to suffer for it. Starting with C#8.0 developers now have the option to get rid of this pain with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">Nullable reference types</a>. Does this mean that null doesn''t exist anymore? No but you have to be explicit about it.<br><br>Reference types now behave like value types for example (bool, int, char, etc.)<br><br>When you want to create a nullable string now you have to define it as follows:<br>string? name;<br><br>Then when ever you use this variable in your code without first checking for a null reference you will get a compiler warning.<br><br>To be able to introduce this concept gradually in your code this feature can be enabled per project or per class see also <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/upgrade-to-nullable-references">Upgrade to nullable references</a>.<br><br>We see this feature as a way to better declare the intent of our code and a good practice to prevent the dreaded Null Reference Exception.'

  description: 'With <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy">Yarp</a>, a .Net application can be extended with a build-in reverse proxy. In a world of front applications and many backend micros-service, a reverse proxy could help to have a single endpoint for many different endpoints, aka servers. Yarp is a fast, lightweight, extendable .Net based Reverse proxy. Yarp uses the ASP.NET pipeline technology to managing incoming requests and routes the request streams to its destination. Routing could be done on configuration of on you own written logic. Because the reverse proxy application is just a piece of .Net code, its familiar and easy to work with. Namely, to code, to have it in source control and in your CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure. <br /><br /> Yarp is still experimental, and for bigger projects solution like <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> (a reverse-proxy) are a better solution. But it has potential, and could replace in time an <a href="https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot">Ocelot</a> (an api gateway) application (if you do not need the request/response bodies). At XPRTZ we keep track of this Microsoft project.'

This enables us to simply declare what the environment we want Terraform to create should look like, without needing to specify every single step that needs to be executed to create it. This also means that we can see exactly what is configured on each environment without having to parse dozens of install scripts.'

With FakeItEasy the units external dependencies are replaced with Dummies, Mockes, Stubs or Fakes.

The framework allows an easy setup of an external dependency, and also the verification if external dependency call''s. The unit may call Mocking framework with an intuitive and fluent syntax. <br /><br /> Other mocking/isolation frameworks such as NSubstitute and Moq do the same job, but FakeItEasy makes it really, yes, easy..

  description: 'With <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> you can easily create testfixures. When writing test code, you want to write code for that specific test case, and not all plumming code to initialize test objects because they require so. When initializing test objects only the test relvante parts are specified. The non-relevant parts are automatically filled with dummy data during execution. The test case is focused on the essentials of the testcase its self instead of object initialized. <br /><br /> There are alternatives such as <a href="https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus">Bogus</a>, which also generate fake data in test objects. An advantage of AutoFixture for asserting fake objects is the initialization of all properties with data, instead with Bogus only set properties are filled. It''s more which flavour you want. <br /><br /> We at XPRTZ use this all the time when writing unit tests. It makes Test-Driven Development a step easier and our lives as developers happier.'

  isNew: TRUE
  description: 'With <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html">event-driven</a> architecture events are used to trigger and communicate between decoupled Microservices. An event is any change in a state, e.g. a customer is updated or even an external triggered situation. There are three key components in Event-driven architecture, namely event producers, event routers/mediators, and event consumers. The architecture is decoupled or lose coupled because producers don’t know which consumers are listening for an event, and what the consequences are of its occurrence. The Azure platform itself is can be used as an event producer, e.g. <i>Cosmos DB</i> change event or scaling events from App service plans. <br /><br />Platforms like Kafka or Dapr are good solutions to use in applications based on an event-driven architecture. But also basic messaging systems like <i>RabbitMQ</i>, <i>Service Bus</i> or <i>Azure Event Grid</i> will suffice but may require more "low-level" programming.

  description: 'With <a href="https://dapr.io">Dapr</a> you have building blocks for building distributed applications. The shift away from monolithic applications to Microservices provided many benefits, but made it also more complex and harder for the developer. Dapr is specifically aimed to help with this in simplifying the development of distributed applications. <br /><br />Dapr is using <i>Kubernetes</i> as its primary cloud hosting environment, but it is not required. Dapr has pre-built components that solve a common set of problems in distributed applications, e.g. service invocation, state management, event handling, and many more. The key concept of Dapr is that it uses sidecars (small applications running along with your Microservices) to operate it main functionalities.<br /><br />We haven’t used it in projects, but we follow the progress Dapr with a lot of interest.'

It uses Protobuf to serialize the messages to a binary message format, making the payload significant smaller compared to JSON. It supports both HTTP and HTTP2. <br /><br />Most web backend developers switched from SOAP to JSON (REST) / OpenAPI services past decade, and this is in many cases the best solution. But, when you have massive numbers of remote calls and milliseconds matter and both sides could be changed, gPRC should definitely be considered as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. <br /><br />We have used gPRC in Microservice architecture environments where low latency was required.'
