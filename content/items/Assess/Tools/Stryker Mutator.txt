Stryker Mutator is a mutation testing framework for .NET, JavaScript and Scala. Mutation testing is used to test your unit tests by creating mutants, each mutant is a mutation of your code. For each mutant, all tests will be run to see if a test fails, this way you can check the quality of your tests and if you need to add more to cover more scenarios. On the <a href="https://stryker-mutator.io">website</a> you will find good documentation which makes it easy to start using Stryker Mutator. It also is very configurable and easy to integrate in your pipeline with the available dotnet tool.
