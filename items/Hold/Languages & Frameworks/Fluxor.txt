<a href="https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor">Fluxor</a> is a Flux/Redux implementation for use in .Net and Blazor, to separate state changes and state reads and to be able to reuse data in different parts of the application with a single source of truth. While the redux pattern is a useful pattern, this implementation is quite hard to test, without wiring up your whole application.
