<b>Fluent Assertions</b> is set of extension methods that allows you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style unit tests. In Fluent Assertions 8 the license model changed from Apache 2.0 to a model that requires an expensive subscription per developer for commercial use. Since v7 can still be used without a license we don't think existing projects need to migrate immediately. Consider alternative libraries for greenfield projects to avoid high licensing costs which may be a hard sell to decision-makers.
