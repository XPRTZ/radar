With <b>AutoFixture</b> you can easily create test fixures. While writing tests you want to focus on the test case and not be burdened by all the boring setup that is required. When initializing test objects with AutoFixture, only test relevant parts are specified, non-relevant parts are automatically filled with dummy data. Now your test case is focused on the essentials instead of object initialization.

We use this when writing unit tests. It makes Test-Driven Development a step easier and our lives as developers happier. There are alternatives such as Bogus, which also generates fake data in test objects. An advantage of AutoFixture is the initialization of all properties with data.Bogus only sets properties that are filled. It's more which flavour you prefer.
