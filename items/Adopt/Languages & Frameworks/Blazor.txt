<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> is a client-side UI framework that allows you to build interactive web UIs using C#. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code are written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. Blazor can run directly in the browser using WebAsssembly, alternatively it can run client-side logic on the server by sending UI events to the server and receiving UI changes back using SignalR.

In modern web development where there's already an oversaturation of Javascript frameworks, Blazor offers .NET developers a new alternative to write client-side code without having to learn a new or unfamiliar language or framework.
