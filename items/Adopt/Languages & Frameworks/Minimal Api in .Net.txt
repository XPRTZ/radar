<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis">Minimal APIs</a> are a new feature since .NET 6 that allows you to create HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. Minimal APIs are ideal for microservices and apps that only need minimal dependencies and features. If you are new to .NET, using Minimal APIs can be helpful, because you do not have to learn and understand the ASP.NET Core MVC framework first to create your HTTP API.

With Minimal APIs you can create new HTTP APIs with just a few lines of code. At first, features like API versioning were not available yet, but as of .Net 7 we would have no problems using it for full featured APIs. Minimal APIs will not replace the traditional MVC framework, so there is no need to refactor existing applications, but it is a new possibility to create a HTTP API.

We see Minimal APIs as an excellent choice for creating all kinds of new HTTP APIs and would consider using it when starting a new project.
