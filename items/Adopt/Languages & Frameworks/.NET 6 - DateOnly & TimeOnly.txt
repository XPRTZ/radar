.NET 6 introduces two new value types, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/date-time-and-time-zone-enhancements-in-net-6/#introducing-the-dateonly-and-timeonly-types">DateOnly and TimeOnly</a>, that represent either only the date or time portion of a DateTime. Both types are available in the System namespace and are built-in to .NET. These two types solve the unnecessary component of the DateTime type when we're only concerned about one portion. For example: When we want to save a date of birth we're probably not concerned about the time component of a DateTime, in this case the DateOnly type is more ideal.
