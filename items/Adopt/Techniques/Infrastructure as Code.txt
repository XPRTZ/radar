As developers we love to automate as many mundane tasks as we can: building our software, testing it and deploying it to production can all be automated these days with CI/CD tools like Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions. So why not do the same with provisioning and maintaining the infrastructure our applications run on? Now that many applications run on virtual infrastructures like VMs or even containers, there is no reason to manage these with software as well. That is what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a> (IaC).

By automating all management of the infrastructure we can both reduce the risk of environments getting out of sync (because we forget to install some updates on one of them) and increase the speed of scaling our environments in our out (because we don't have to go through a length manual process to provision a new environment, it's just an automated script).
