<a href="https://martendb.io/">Marten</a> is a library provided as a Nuget package which gives .NET developers the ability to easily use the PostgreSQL database engine and its JSON support as a fully-fledged document database. Many of the Marten contributors were fans of the existing RavenDb database but wanted a more robust underlying technology. To that end, Marten was largely created to efficiently use the proven PostgreSQL database engine as a document database and act as a near drop-in replacement for RavenDb in several existing applications. As such, you may clearly see some influence from RavenDb on the Marten services and API's.

The feature we like the most is the ability to transform a PostgreSQL database in an event store with Marten. It utilizes the strong JSONB support to expose an ACID-compliant event store implementation over the PostgreSQL database. It also takes advantage of PostgreSQL's embedded JavaScript support to enable effective user-defined projections against your event streams.
