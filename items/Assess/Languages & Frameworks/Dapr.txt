<a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a> gives you building blocks for building distributed applications. The shift from monolithic applications to Microservices provided many benefits but also make developing more complex because all these microservices need to share many cross-cutting concerns. Dapr is specifically aimed to help by simplifying the development of distributed applications. Dapr is using Kubernetes as its primary cloud hosting environment, but it is not required. Alternatives include self-hosting using Docker or going serverless with Azure Container Apps. Dapr has pre-built components that solve a common set of problems in distributed applications, e.g., service invocation, state management, event handling and many more. The key concept of Dapr is that it uses sidecars (small applications running along with your Microservices) to operate its main functions. We are following the progress of Dapr with great interest and will continue to do so, but weâ€™re still reluctant to using and recommending it due to the seemingly low adoption, poor development tooling and very specific fit for purpose.
