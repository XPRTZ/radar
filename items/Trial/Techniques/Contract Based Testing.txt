Contract-based testing is a technique used in developing systems where interactions between various components or services are verified against a contract. The primary reason to use contract-based testing is to detect problems early in the development cycle, especially in a microservices architecture or any distributed system where components are developed by different teams that may be working in parallel. Pact is a popular tool used in contract-based testing.
