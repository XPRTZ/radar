<a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a> is a Github tool used to automatically keep your project dependencies up to date. Dependabot first checks your project dependencies for any updates and if there are any a pull request is created. You can review and run the necessary tests on the pull request before merging it.

With Dependabot you spend less time updating your project dependencies and have more time to build.
